# Connecting an Android client

## Goal

This documentation has the goal of showing how a user can use the official Android [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) client with `headscale`.

## Installation

Install the official Tailscale Android client from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tailscale.ipn) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.tailscale.ipn/).

Ensure that the installed version is at least 1.30.0, as that is the first release to support custom URLs.

## Configuring the headscale URL

After opening the app:

- Open setting and go into account settings
- In the kebab menu icon (three dots) on the top bar on the right select “Use an alternate server”
- Enter your server URL and follow the instructions
