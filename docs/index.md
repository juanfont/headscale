## Design goal

Headscale aims to implement a self-hosted, open source alternative to the Tailscale
control server.
Headscale's goal is to provide self-hosters and hobbyists with an open-source
server they can use for their projects and labs.
It implements a narrower scope, a single Tailnet, suitable for a personal use, or a small
open-source organisation.

## Supporting headscale

If you like `headscale` and find it useful, there is a sponsorship and donation
buttons available in the repo.

## Contributing

Headscale is "Open Source, acknowledged contribution", this means that any
contribution will have to be discussed with the Maintainers before being submitted.

This model has been chosen to reduce the risk of burnout by limiting the
maintenance overhead of reviewing and validating third-party code.

Headscale is open to code contributions for bug fixes without discussion.

If you find mistakes in the documentation, please submit a fix to the documentation.
