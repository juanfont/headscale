## 0.14.0 (2022-02-24)

**UPCOMING ### BREAKING
From the **next\*\* version (`0.15.0`), all machines will be able to communicate regardless of
if they are in the same namespace. This means that the behaviour currently limited to ACLs
will become default. From version `0.15.0`, all limitation of communications must be done
with ACLs.

This is a part of aligning `headscale`'s behaviour with Tailscale's upstream behaviour.

### BREAKING

- ACLs have been rewritten to align with the bevaviour Tailscale Control Panel provides. **NOTE:** This is only active if you use ACLs
  - Namespaces are now treated as Users
  - All machines can communicate with all machines by default
  - Tags should now work correctly and adding a host to Headscale should now reload the rules.
  - The documentation have a [fictional example](docs/acls.md) that should cover some use cases of the ACLs features
