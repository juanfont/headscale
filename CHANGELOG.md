  - SSH ACLs status:
    - Support `accept` and `check` (SSH can be enabled and used for connecting and authentication)
    - Rejecting connections **are not supported**, meaning that if you enable SSH, then assume that _all_ `ssh` connections **will be allowed**.
    - If you decied to try this feature, please carefully managed permissions by blocking port `22` with regular ACLs or do _not_ set `--ssh` on your clients.
    - We are currently improving our testing of the SSH ACLs, help us get an overview by testing and giving feedback.
  - This feature should be considered dangerous and it is disabled by default. Enable by setting `HEADSCALE_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURE_SSH=1`.

## 0.14.0 (2022-02-24)

**UPCOMING ### BREAKING
From the **next\*\* version (`0.15.0`), all machines will be able to communicate regardless of
if they are in the same namespace. This means that the behaviour currently limited to ACLs
will become default. From version `0.15.0`, all limitation of communications must be done
with ACLs.

This is a part of aligning `headscale`'s behaviour with Tailscale's upstream behaviour.

### BREAKING

- ACLs have been rewritten to align with the bevaviour Tailscale Control Panel provides. **NOTE:** This is only active if you use ACLs
  - Namespaces are now treated as Users
  - All machines can communicate with all machines by default
  - Tags should now work correctly and adding a host to Headscale should now reload the rules.
  - The documentation have a [fictional example](docs/acls.md) that should cover some use cases of the ACLs features
