# CHANGELOG

## 0.15.0 (2022-xx-xx)

**Note:** Take a backup of your database before upgrading.

### BREAKING

- Boundaries between Namespaces has been removed and all nodes can communicate by default [#357](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/pull/357)
  - To limit access between nodes, use [ACLs](./docs/acls.md).

### Features

- Add support for writing ACL files with YAML [#359](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/pull/359)
- Users can now use emails in ACL's groups [#372](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/issues/372)
- Add shorthand aliases for commands and subcommands [#376](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/pull/376)

### Changes

- Fix a bug were the same IP could be assigned to multiple hosts if joined in quick succession [#346](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/pull/346)
- Simplify the code behind registration of machines [#366](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/pull/366)
  - Nodes are now only written to database if they are registrated successfully
- Fix a limitation in the ACLs that prevented users to write rules with `*` as source [#374](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/issues/374)
- Reduce the overhead of marshal/unmarshal for Hostinfo, routes and endpoints by using specific types in Machine [#371](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/pull/371)

## 0.14.0 (2022-02-24)

**UPCOMING ### BREAKING
From the **next\*\* version (`0.15.0`), all machines will be able to communicate regardless of
if they are in the same namespace. This means that the behaviour currently limited to ACLs
will become default. From version `0.15.0`, all limitation of communications must be done
with ACLs.

This is a part of aligning `headscale`'s behaviour with Tailscale's upstream behaviour.

### BREAKING

- ACLs have been rewritten to align with the bevaviour Tailscale Control Panel provides. **NOTE:** This is only active if you use ACLs
  - Namespaces are now treated as Users
  - All machines can communicate with all machines by default
  - Tags should now work correctly and adding a host to Headscale should now reload the rules.
  - The documentation have a [fictional example](docs/acls.md) that should cover some use cases of the ACLs features
