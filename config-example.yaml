# headscale will look for a configuration file named `config.yaml` (or `config.json`) in the following order:
#
# - `/etc/headscale`
# - `~/.headscale`
# - current working directory

# The url clients will connect to.
# Typically this will be a domain like:
#
# https://myheadscale.example.com:443
#
server_url: http://127.0.0.1:8080

# Address to listen to / bind to on the server
#
listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:8080

# Address to listen to /metrics, you may want
# to keep this endpoint private to your internal
# network
#
metrics_listen_addr: 127.0.0.1:9090

# Address to listen for gRPC.
# gRPC is used for controlling a headscale server
# remotely with the CLI
# Note: Remote access _only_ works if you have
# valid certificates.
grpc_listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:50443

# Allow the gRPC admin interface to run in INSECURE
# mode. This is not recommended as the traffic will
# be unencrypted. Only enable if you know what you
# are doing.
grpc_allow_insecure: false

# Private key used encrypt the traffic between headscale
# and Tailscale clients.
# The private key file which will be
# autogenerated if it's missing
private_key_path: /var/lib/headscale/private.key

# List of IP prefixes to allocate tailaddresses from.
# Each prefix consists of either an IPv4 or IPv6 address,
# and the associated prefix length, delimited by a slash.

  - fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48
  - 100.64.0.0/10

# DERP is a relay system that Tailscale uses when a direct
# connection cannot be established.
# https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/#encrypted-tcp-relays-derp
#
# headscale needs a list of DERP servers that can be presented
# to the clients.
derp:
  server:
    # If enabled, runs the embedded DERP server and merges it into the rest of the DERP config
    # The Headscale server_url defined above MUST be using https, DERP requires TLS to be in place
    enabled: false

    # Region ID to use for the embedded DERP server.
    # The local DERP prevails if the region ID collides with other region ID coming from
    # the regular DERP config.
    region_id: 999

    # Region code and name are displayed in the Tailscale UI to identify a DERP region
    region_code: "headscale"
    region_name: "Headscale Embedded DERP"

    # Listens in UDP at the configured address for STUN connections to help on NAT traversal.
    # When the embedded DERP server is enabled stun_listen_addr MUST be defined.

    stun_listen_addr: "0.0.0.0:3478"

  # List of externally available DERP maps encoded in JSON
  urls:
    - https://controlplane.tailscale.com/derpmap/default

  # Locally available DERP map files encoded in YAML
  #
  # This option is mostly interesting for people hosting
  # their own DERP servers:

  # paths:
  #   - /etc/headscale/derp-example.yaml

  # How often should we check for DERP updates?
  update_frequency: 24h

# Disables the automatic check for headscale updates on startup
disable_check_updates: false

# Time before an inactive ephemeral node is deleted?
ephemeral_node_inactivity_timeout: 30m

# Period to check for node updates in the tailnet. A value too low will severily affect
# CPU consumption of Headscale. A value too high (over 60s) will cause problems
# to the nodes, as they won't get updates or keep alive messages in time.
# In case of doubts, do not touch the default 10s.

### TLS configuration
#
## Let's encrypt / ACME
#
# headscale supports automatically requesting and setting up
# TLS for a domain with Let's Encrypt.
#
# URL to ACME directory
acme_url: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory

# Email to register with ACME provider
acme_email: ""

# Domain name to request a TLS certificate for:
tls_letsencrypt_hostname: ""

# Client (Tailscale/Browser) authentication mode (mTLS)
# Acceptable values:
# - disabled: client authentication disabled
# - relaxed: client certificate is required but not verified
# - enforced: client certificate is required and verified
tls_client_auth_mode: relaxed

# Path to store certificates and metadata needed by
# letsencrypt
tls_letsencrypt_cache_dir: /var/lib/headscale/cache

# Type of ACME challenge to use, currently supported types:
# HTTP-01 or TLS-ALPN-01
# See [docs/tls.md](docs/tls.md) for more information
tls_letsencrypt_challenge_type: HTTP-01
# When HTTP-01 challenge is chosen, letsencrypt must set up a
# verification endpoint, and it will be listning on:
# :http = port 80
tls_letsencrypt_listen: ":http"

## Use already defined certificates:
tls_cert_path: ""
tls_key_path: ""

log_level: info

# Path to a file containg ACL policies.
# ACLs can be defined as YAML or HUJSON.
# https://tailscale.com/kb/1018/acls/

## DNS
#
# headscale supports Tailscale's DNS configuration and MagicDNS.
# Please have a look to their KB to better understand the concepts:
#
# - https://tailscale.com/kb/1054/dns/
# - https://tailscale.com/kb/1081/magicdns/
# - https://tailscale.com/blog/2021-09-private-dns-with-magicdns/
#
dns_config:
  # List of DNS servers to expose to clients.
  nameservers:
    - 1.1.1.1

  # Split DNS (see https://tailscale.com/kb/1054/dns/),
  # list of search domains and the DNS to query for each one.
  #
  # restricted_nameservers:
  #   foo.bar.com:
  #     - 1.1.1.1
  #   darp.headscale.net:
  #     - 1.1.1.1
  #     - 8.8.8.8

  # Search domains to inject.
  domains: []

  # Whether to use [MagicDNS](https://tailscale.com/kb/1081/magicdns/).
  # Only works if there is at least a nameserver defined.
  magic_dns: true

  # Defines the base domain to create the hostnames for MagicDNS.
  # `base_domain` must be a FQDNs, without the trailing dot.
  # The FQDN of the hosts will be
  # `hostname.namespace.base_domain` (e.g., _myhost.mynamespace.example.com_).
  base_domain: example.com

# Unix socket used for the CLI to connect without authentication
# Note: for local development, you probably want to change this to:
# unix_socket: ./headscale.sock
unix_socket: /var/run/headscale.sock
unix_socket_permission: "0770"
#
# headscale supports experimental OpenID connect support,
# it is still being tested and might have some bugs, please
# help us test it.
# OpenID Connect
# oidc:
#   issuer: "https://your-oidc.issuer.com/path"
#   client_id: "your-oidc-client-id"
#   client_secret: "your-oidc-client-secret"
#
#   Customize the scopes used in the OIDC flow, defaults to "openid", "profile" and "email" and add custom query
#   parameters to the Authorize Endpoint request. Scopes default to "openid", "profile" and "email".
#
#   scope: ["openid", "profile", "email", "custom"]
#   extra_params:
#     domain_hint: example.com
#
#   List allowed principal domains and/or users. If an authenticated user's domain is not in this list, the
#   authentication request will be rejected.
#
#   allowed_domains:
#     - example.com
#   allowed_users:
#     - alice@example.com
#
#   If `strip_email_domain` is set to `true`, the domain part of the username email address will be removed.
#   This will transform `first-name.last-name@example.com` to the namespace `first-name.last-name`
#   If `strip_email_domain` is set to `false` the domain part will NOT be removed resulting to the following
#   namespace: `first-name.last-name.example.com`
#
#   strip_email_domain: true

# Logtail configuration
# Logtail is Tailscales logging and auditing infrastructure, it allows the control panel
# to instruct tailscale nodes to log their activity to a remote server.
logtail:
  # Enable logtail for this headscales clients.
  # As there is currently no support for overriding the log server in headscale, this is
  # disabled by default. Enabling this will make your clients send logs to Tailscale Inc.
  enabled: false

# Enabling this option makes devices prefer a random port for WireGuard traffic over the
# default static port 41641. This option is intended as a workaround for some buggy
# firewall devices. See https://tailscale.com/kb/1181/firewalls/ for more information.
randomize_client_port: false
