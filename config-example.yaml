# headscale will look for a configuration file named `config.yaml` (or `config.json`) in the following order:
#
# - `/etc/headscale`
# - `~/.headscale`
# - current working directory

# The url clients will connect to.
# Typically this will be a domain like:
#
# https://myheadscale.example.com:443
#
server_url: http://127.0.0.1:8080

# Address to listen to / bind to on the server
#
# For production:
# listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:8080
listen_addr: 127.0.0.1:8080

# Address to listen to /metrics, you may want
# to keep this endpoint private to your internal
# network
#
metrics_listen_addr: 127.0.0.1:9090

# Address to listen for gRPC.
# gRPC is used for controlling a headscale server
# remotely with the CLI
# Note: Remote access _only_ works if you have
# valid certificates.
#
# For production:
# grpc_listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:50443
grpc_listen_addr: 127.0.0.1:50443

# Allow the gRPC admin interface to run in INSECURE
# mode. This is not recommended as the traffic will
# be unencrypted. Only enable if you know what you
# are doing.

# The Noise section includes specific configuration for the
# TS2021 Noise protocol

# List of IP prefixes to allocate tailaddresses from.
# Each prefix consists of either an IPv4 or IPv6 address,

# It must be within IP ranges supported by the Tailscale
# client - i.e., subnets of 100.64.0.0/10 and fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48.
# See below:

# DERP is a relay system that Tailscale uses when a direct
# connection cannot be established.
# https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/#encrypted-tcp-relays-derp

# to the clients.
derp:

    automatically_add_embedded_derp_region: true

    # For better connection stability (especially when using an Exit-Node and DNS is not working),

### TLS configuration
#
## Let's encrypt / ACME
#
# headscale supports automatically requesting and setting up
# TLS for a domain with Let's Encrypt.
#
# URL to ACME directory
acme_url: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory

# Email to register with ACME provider
acme_email: ""

# Domain name to request a TLS certificate for:
tls_letsencrypt_hostname: ""

# Path to store certificates and metadata needed by
# letsencrypt
# For production:
tls_letsencrypt_cache_dir: /var/lib/headscale/cache

# Type of ACME challenge to use, currently supported types:
# HTTP-01 or TLS-ALPN-01
# See: docs/ref/tls.md for more information
tls_letsencrypt_challenge_type: HTTP-01
# When HTTP-01 challenge is chosen, letsencrypt must set up a
# verification endpoint, and it will be listening on:
# :http = port 80
tls_letsencrypt_listen: ":http"

## Use already defined certificates:
tls_cert_path: ""
tls_key_path: ""

log:
  # Output formatting for logs: text or json

## Policy
# headscale supports Tailscale's ACL policies.
# Please have a look to their KB to better
# understand the concepts: https://tailscale.com/kb/1018/acls/
policy:
  # The mode can be "file" or "database" that defines
  # where the ACL policies are stored and read from.
  mode: file
  # If the mode is set to "file", the path to a
  # HuJSON file containing ACL policies.

## DNS
#
# headscale supports Tailscale's DNS configuration and MagicDNS.
# Please have a look to their KB to better understand the concepts:

#
# Please note that for the DNS configuration to have any effect,
# clients must have the `--accept-dns=true` option enabled. This is the
# default for the Tailscale client. This option is enabled by default
# in the Tailscale client.
#
# Setting _any_ of the configuration and `--accept-dns=true` on the
# clients will integrate with the DNS manager on the client or
# overwrite /etc/resolv.conf.
# https://tailscale.com/kb/1235/resolv-conf
#
# If you want stop Headscale from managing the DNS configuration
# all the fields under `dns` should be set to empty values.
