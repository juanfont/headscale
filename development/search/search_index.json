As often stated, Headscale is not enterprise software and our focus is homelabbers and self-hosters. Of course, we do not prevent people from using it in a commercial/professional setting and often get questions about scaling.</p> <p>Please note that when Headscale is developed, performance is not part of the consideration as the main audience is considered to be users with a modest amount of devices. We focus on correctness and feature parity with Tailscale SaaS over time.</p> <p>To understand if you might be able to use Headscale for your use case, I will describe two scenarios in an effort to explain what is the central bottleneck of Headscale:</p> <ol> <li> <p>An environment with 1000 servers</p> </li> <li> <p>they rarely \"move\" (change their endpoints)</p> </li> <li> <p>new nodes are added rarely</p> </li> <li> <p>An environment with 80 laptops/phones (end user devices)</p> </li> <li> <p>nodes move often, e.g. switching from home to office</p> </li> </ol> <p>Headscale calculates a map of all nodes that need to talk to each other, creating this \"world map\" requires a lot of CPU time. When an event that requires changes to this map happens, the whole \"world\" is recalculated, and a new \"world map\" is created for every node in the network.</p> <p>This means that under certain conditions, Headscale can likely handle 100s of devices (maybe more), if there is little to no change happening in the network. For example, in Scenario 1, the process of computing the world map is extremely demanding due to the size of the network, but when the map has been created and the nodes are not changing, the Headscale instance will likely return to a very low resource usage until the next time there is an event requiring the new map.</p> <p>In the case of Scenario 2, the process of computing the world map is less demanding due to the smaller size of the network, however, the type of nodes will likely change frequently, which would lead to a constant resource usage.</p> <p>Headscale will start to struggle when the two scenarios overlap, e.g. many nodes with frequent changes will cause the resource usage to remain constantly high. In the worst case scenario, the queue of nodes waiting for their map will grow to a point where Headscale never will be able to catch up, and nodes will never learn about the current state of the world.</p> <p>We expect that the performance will improve over time as we improve the code base, but it is not a focus. In general, we will never make the tradeoff to make things faster on the cost of less maintainable or readable code. We are a small team and have to optimise for maintainability.</p>"},{"location":"about/faq/#which-database-should-i-use","title":"Which database should I use?","text":"<p>We recommend the use of SQLite as database for headscale:</p> <ul> <li>SQLite is simple to setup and easy to use</li> <li>It scales well for all of headscale's use cases</li> <li>Development and testing happens primarily on SQLite</li> <li>PostgreSQL is still supported, but is considered to be in \"maintenance mode\"</li> </ul> <p>The headscale project itself does not provide a tool to migrate from PostgreSQL to SQLite.
